# Python_Basics_Project

This project aimed to use Python's essential functions and methods to generate a short analysis of two data sets. One is associated with the bank financial data (Resources/ budget_data.csv) and the second one with poll results (Resources / eleection_data.csv). 

The budget_data analysis pretended to respond to the following questions:

- The total number of months included in the dataset. 
- The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. 
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" during the whole period (list comprehension. 
- The most significant increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. 
- The most significant decrease in losses (date and amount) for the whole period

On the other hand, the eleection_data.csv analyzed looked to respond to the following questions:

- The total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Functions like sum, max, append, zip, and len; methods like list comprehensions and loops, and conditional statements are part of this analysis to find the correct answers.
